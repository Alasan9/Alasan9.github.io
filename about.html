    <p class="card-text">Over the last two years I have continuously strived to gain and improve my
knowledge throughout all aspects of the web. I first studied HTML and CSS
through a coputer lap named Le Seppie; the lap that were
provided helped to give me a foundation which I could later build upon. Using
this lap I also went on to gain a basic understanding of programming using
the Bootstrap and Java-script programming languages. Once I felt comfortable using HTML,
CSS, Bootstrap and Java-script I went on to study from another website named Treehouse.com.
This transition greatly helped improve my knowledge of both Bootstrap and CSS to the
point where I can now create basic dynamic websites without the aid of tutorials.
I have been using youtube.com to expand my knowledge, the most recent being Digital
Design for Print and Web. This has greatly improved my ability to create
aesthetically pleasing user interfaces.

My dedication to self-improvement in web design and development has inspired
me to study web at a university, where I hope to incorporate new ideas with my
own knowledge in a practical and beneficial way, as well as to add work to a
future portfolio. Over the course of my designing and developing, I have
identified several areas in which I struggled and have decided, in order to make
my transfer to university easier, to spend the next year focusing and developing
my knowledge in those areas by researching and experimenting with new ideas
to find a practise that is both practical and compliments my style.

Last year I successfully completed a IT Extended Diploma in (WORD PROCESSING, SPREADSHEET,
DATABASE AND GRAPHIC DESIGN)(Interactive Media) which greatly helped me develop imagination and creativity.
Throughout this course we studied a wide range of design techniques that I
would like to build upon, as well as development techniques that could be used
specifically for website creation. While working on website design and
development I was taught numerous techniques such as compressing images for
the web with Adobe Photoshop. This helped me significantly at the time as I was
working on an image heavy website and I still continue to compress images to
this day. I was also taught how to use Adobe Dreamweaver due to the many
features that the program has to offer such as the drag and drop functionality,
file management system and easy FTP upload. Although I enjoyed using the
program for the more intricate projects, I still enjoy the challenge and mental
stimulation that hand coding provides.

I am currently studying on a BTEC Subsidiary Diploma in IT in order to gain a
business view of how websites are created. We are currently studying Unit 1 - Communication and Employability Skills for IT. This has given me knowledge and
understanding of attributes that employer's value and the ability to communicate
effectively using different communication channels such as word processed
documents, presentations and social media, among others. We have looked at
accessibility which is relevant in business, in particular to websites. I will also
gain the ability to address my own personal development needs. Later this year I
will be studying Website Production and Management in which we have to design
and create a website to a client's specifications. Creating a website from analysis
to implementation will give me the ability to merge the skills that I have attained
through the study of media and IT.

I am keen to promote a healthy lifestyle and realise the importance of a work-life
balance. Over the last two years I have grown fond of endurance sports as I
discovered I like to see how far I can push myself.

Over the last two years I have found a number of people who have inspired me,
people such as Florian Siegel, kevin Faure and Pierre. These people
revolutionised how we use technology in our everyday lives and without their
innovative thinking, everything that we have accomplished today would still be a
dream and not a reality.
